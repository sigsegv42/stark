# libstark

This is a small utility library of base code shared between some of my small game projects (e.g. voxel &amp; ld26).  It mostly consists of glue on top of the v3dlibs which didn't really fit in to the existing libraries, but end up being useful in multiple apps.

## Classes

* AssetLoader - A simple text asset file loader
* ProgramFactory - A factory for creating GL shader programs
